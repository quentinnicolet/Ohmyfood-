# OH MY FOOD
Welcome to OH MY FOOD, a cutting-edge project designed to bring a seamless and streamlined online reservation experience to restaurant-goers. Our mobile-first website is specifically tailored to meet the needs of today's tech-savvy diners, combining the latest development techniques with intuitive design to create a platform that is both efficient and easy to use.

To achieve this goal, we have employed a variety of development techniques, including semantic HTML, a mobile-first approach, and CSS animations and transitions to enhance the user experience. We also employ intuitive navigation that makes it easy to find the restaurant that meets your needs, whether you're looking for a romantic dinner for two or a large family gathering.

To make this possible, we rely on a range of technical tools, including CSS and SASS, as well as HTML. To get started, you'll need to download our project and follow a few simple steps to launch it on your local server. This includes opening your IDE command terminal and typing "NPM Start", which will allow the project to launch in your browser and run on your local server at port 3000.

So if you're ready to revolutionize your restaurant reservation experience, OH MY FOOD is the platform you've been waiting for. With its intuitive design and cutting-edge features, it's never been easier to book a table at your favorite restaurant.
